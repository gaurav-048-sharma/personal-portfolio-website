### How to Use This
1. **Create a Project Folder**:
   - Make a new folder (e.g., `your-portfolio`).

2. **Copy and Paste**:
   - Open your text editor (e.g., VS Code).
   - Create each file (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`) in the folder.
   - Copy the corresponding content from above and paste it into each file.

3. **Add Assets**:
   - Create an `assets` subfolder.
   - Add your images: `profile.jpg`, `project1.jpg` to `project6.jpg`, `github-icon.png`, `website-icon.png`, `linkedin-icon.png`, `twitter-icon.png`.
   - Optionally add `preview.jpg` for the README.

4. **Customize**:
   - Replace placeholders (`Your Name`, `yourusername`, project links, EmailJS credentials) with your details.

5. **Test**:
   - Open `index.html` with a local server (e.g., `npx live-server`) to ensure everything works.

This gives you the entire project in a format you can easily copy and paste. Let me know if you need help with any specific part of the setup!
